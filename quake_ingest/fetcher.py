    # if name == "main" Summary:

# When Python runs a file, it sets the special variable __name__ to:

# "__main__" if the file is executed directly
# The module name if the file is imported


# This pattern (if __name__ == "__main__":) creates a conditional block that only executes when the file is run directly, not when imported.
# For async code, you need this pattern because:

# await can only be used inside async functions, not at module level
# You need asyncio.run() to create an event loop and execute coroutines


# When a module is imported, Python executes all code at module level:

# Function definitions are processed
# Any executable code outside functions runs immediately
# Code inside the if-block is skipped during imports


# This pattern allows your file to serve dual purposes:

# As a reusable module for other parts of your application
# As a standalone script for testing/debugging
